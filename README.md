# Movie Trailer Website

**Movie Trailer Website** is a project that has been written for **Udacity's Full Stack Developer Nanodegree Program**.

In this project, it will display six of my favorite movies that I have selected. When the image of the movie is clicked, the corresponding movie trailer shall display via youtube.

## Installation

* Cereal (you can find cool cereals [here](www.example.com/coolcereals))

* Milk

## Directions

If I were writing these out as _code_, it might look something like this:

```
if bowl is empty:
    add cereal
if bowl only has cereal in it:
    add milk 
```
