# ud036_StarterCode
Source code for a Movie Trailer website.

Forked from Udacity's Movie project: this populates a webpage with a few of my favorite movies.
- in addition to the code, I'm incorporating Code Climate analysis, which produces [these results](https://codeclimate.com/github/efueger/ud036_StarterCode).

Code Climate checks enabled:
- PEP8
