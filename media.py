'''This class Movie() is like a blue print with a constructor that creates
instance variables to create an instance of the class Movie(). After an
instance is created, the class constructor gets called. This is the
__init__ method inside the class. This __init__ method initializes all
of the data inside the class. The constuctor uses the key word self.
You can think of the key word self as itself of the instances in question.
So if an instance of Avatar is being created, Avatar is self.'''
